In a DDoS attack, the attacker tries to make a particular service unavailable by directing continuous and huge traffic from multiple end systems. Due to this enormous traffic, the network resources get utilized in serving requests of those false end systems such that, a legitimate user is unable to access the resources for himself/herself. 

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of DOS attack where multiple systems, which are trojan infected, target a particular system which causes a DoS attack. 

A DDoS attack uses multiple servers and Internet connections to flood the targeted resource.
